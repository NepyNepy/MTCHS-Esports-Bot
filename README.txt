Hello fellow studnets and or teachers.

These files are being used for a project from a Senior as the second semister Project. 

Please do not remove these files, if they are causing problems please email zachary.chrysler@mtchs.org

When you remove files it makes the code project fail and caused the senior to find the error for 20+ minutes.

Thanks for the understanding.


If you are here in the future trying to help finish the discord bot for the other teams let me explain the lack of comments after the main page.
All of this code I wouldn't call original, and made by myself. The only code that was made by me was all the commands here currently besides ping.js.
At the time of you working on this project you most likely know some things about javascript. All files here are coded in javascript and have no other langauge
incorperated into it. If you need help to understand some of the code like the code in main, in handlers file, and events file please watch these videos below.
